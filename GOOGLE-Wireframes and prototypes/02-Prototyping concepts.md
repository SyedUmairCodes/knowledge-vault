## Information Architecture
Information architecture is how information is displayed out in your design.  IA helps to organize the content in your designs and makes navigation easier for the user. The more research you do the more ways you'll learn to make the information architecture of your app easier.

> Information architecture is like a treasure map, you need to guide your user to the X mark.

A good information architecture is built using these three things.  

- Organization: How different pieces of information are organized in your app.
- Hierarchy: This shows what should the user focus on first and creates a tree like structure to organize data and sub-data. 
- Sequence: The order in which the user should go through your design.  Information architecture is also a great way to create sitemaps for websites and mobile apps. 

## Basic principles of IA
There are eight basics principles of good information architecture that were created by Dan Brown the founder of EightShapes. These principles help UX designers to understand their products and make decisions accordingly.

- Object principle: You should view your content as “living” and as something that changes and grows over time.
- Choice principle: People think they want to have many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized.
- Disclosure principle: Information should not be unexpected or unnecessary.
- Exemplar principle: Humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.
- Front door principle: People will usually arrive at a homepage from another website.
- Multiple classification principle: People have different ways of searching for information.
- Focused navigation principle: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed.
- Growth principle: The amount of content in a design will grow over time.

## Analog and Digital Wireframes
Creating wireframes of your designs on papers is the quickest and easiest way to get started with your designs. Wireframes allow you design the basic structure of your app that you are designing.

Digital wireframes allow for more flexibility as oppose to paper wireframes. They can look somewhat better than the paper wireframes and also can be interactive so you can create user flows and interactive dialogs to show what would happen if the user clicked on a button.

## Gestalt principle
Gestalt principles are used to describe how humans form connections between shapes and patterns that are similar looking and simplify complex images to better understand them.

By grouping similar items together in your designs you can add a visually pleasing affect for your users. Things like similarity between components, icons, and the distance between them affects how a user feels about your app's design.
