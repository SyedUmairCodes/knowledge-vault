# Introduction to AI
Artifical intelligence ot A,I for short is all the  rage these days everywhere you look people are talking about it and using it ways that wasn't even possible before. A lot of people you might follow on social media use buzz words like MLOps, CNN, GANN, and what not and for someone that's not tech-savvy can be really hard to learn what these acronyms mean and what they actullay are.

These topics are for advance users, tinkerers, and AI practicioners and we are just going dicuss about what AI is and how can you use it.

> In a nutshell: Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer system to act and make decisions based on the material it was trained on just like how humans make decisions.

AI based are booming around these days and AI is set to generate over 13 trillion US dollars annualy by 2030 according to a study conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute in the field of software alone. If it can generate such a ludicurous amount just a single fileld imagine what would the numbers be if AI were to be used in every single field.

And, it's not like that AI isn't used in any other field except software. Infact, retail, medical, automotive, and warehousing are the fields that are benefiting from the AI revolution the most.

## What we have and what we want
All of the available AI systems are Artifical-Narrow-Inteligence or ANI. The ANI systems are programmed in such a way that they can only do one thing and they do that thing very well.

Examples of ANI systems would be a smart home device or a self driving car. These systems perform only a single task and they perform it excellently. A smart speaker will only play and pause or skip a track only when you tell it to and not on it's own.

The perfect AI system would be known as an Artifical-General-Intelligence or AGI that would have the ability to think for it self like humans or even greater.  All of the advancements that are happening in the field of AI are happeining in ANI and people think that AI can do everything but in reality it's just the tip of the iceberg. The real fun will start when we make great advancements in AGI.

> One of the reason that we haven't made much progress in AGI could be that people don't want to create a real-life skynet.

# Machine learning
Machine learning is a type of AI that is used to train AI models that are used to make ANI technologies. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we manually label the data ourselves and then tell the AI to respond to it. We  map all of the training data ourselves and tell the AI the differences between them so that it can do it on it's own.

Machine learning is very popular in the fields of online advertisments, self-driving cars, and the manufacturing industry. Companies use machine learning models to distingush products from faulty ones as soon as they come out from the assembly line which makes the quality of their products much better overall since we can also learn what kind of defect is the most common in the product.

Supervised learning has been around for a long time and the reason that it has been so popular in the recent years is the fact that almost everyone has access to the internet now and that includes in way more data being produced than ever before and most of that data is publicly accessible and so training ML models has become easier than ever before and the more data the model is trained on the better it works.

The advancements in specialzied hardware that can train ML models more quickly than normal hardware such as specialzed CPUs and GPUs and the almost infinite amount of Data available for training is also a big reason why modern AI systems are so accurate. 

# AI and Data
Data is the most important factor that is the driving force behind all the success that AI has today. Data exists in all types of forms and shapes in the modern day and is sometimes just ready to use and sometimes it needs to be cleaned and processed before we can use it.

Huge amounts of data are also called datasets and the word data is also the plural of the word datum which means a single piece of data but all of these words are now used inter-changeably so much that it doesn't matter if you call it data or a dataset.

A sample use case can be to predict the prices of used cars, you can have a spreadsheet or an database that lists the conditions of each car and give them a rating a based on the given conditions. If you keep training your model on the given data it could predict the price of a used car just by looking at the conditions of each of it's parts like mileage, interior/exterior, and the engine quality. (Sorry if I missed something, I'm not a car guy.)

> This model can also work if a customers gives it their budget and the model will recommend cars to the customer  that are equal or lower than their maximum budget.

Machine learning can also be used to detect items and tell the user what they are looking for. You can make a dataset that contains pictures dogs and are manually labelled after training the model will be able to recognize the type of breed the current dog is.
