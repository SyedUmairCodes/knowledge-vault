# Knowledge-vault
A repository containing all of the notes that I have taken while learning different things.

## Introduction
I use Obsidian for all of my note-taking and this repository is a public back-up of all of my notes that I have finished writing.

Due to security concerns I won't be providing the `.obsidian` folder for this repository but instead i'll list my configurations below

> Currently this repo doesn't have a lot of notes but I'm going to be updating them from time to time in the coming weeks.

## Plugins and themes
Obsidian has a lot of wonderful plugins and themes available but currently I'm not using any external plugins only a few core plugins.

I have also switched to using the Red Graphite theme and the fonts are the same as before. `Plus Jakarta Sans` for the editor and UI and `Fira code` for monospace text.

### Core plugins:
- File recovery
- Command pallete
- Canvas
