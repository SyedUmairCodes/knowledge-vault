# Knowledge-vault
A repository containing all of the notes that I have taken while learning different things.

## Setting up the vault
I use Obsidian for all of my note-taking and this repository is a public back-up of all of my notes that I have finished writing.

In order to get the same experience as I have in terms of aesthetics you'll need to download/clone this whole repo and enable of the plugins that I have. 

The `.obsidian` folder is already provided in the repo and you will also need the `Plus Jakarta Sans` and `Fira code` fonts installed on your system for the same text as I have.

> Currently this repo doesn't have a lot of notes but I'm going to be updating them from time to time in the coming weeks.

## Plugins and themes
Obsidian has a lot of wonderful plugins and themes available but I only use  a few plugins and the current theme is Minimal with the MacOS color scheme.

### Core plugins:
- File recovery
- Quick switcher
- Daily notes

### External plugins
- Excalidraw
- Calendar
- Minimal theme settings
- Style settings
- Kanban 
- Icon folder
