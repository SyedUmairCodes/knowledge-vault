# Usability studies
A usability study is a research method that measures how easy it is for end-users to use your products and complete the core tasks your product was designed for.

These types of studies help product teams understand how the real-world users prefer to use their product and how good it holds up in the real-world and they are also budget-friendly so even if your team doesn't have a high budget you can still see how good your product holds up in a real-world scenario without losing major amounts of funding.

> Usability studies are also called usability testing and both terms can be used interchangeably.

# Types of Usability studies
There are two types of usability studies that you can conduct: moderated and un-moderated.

- **Moderated usability studies:** In a moderated study there is a person from the team that acts as a guide and shows all the participants of the study how to use the product this approach allows the team to ask follow-up questions about any-kind doubts or suggestions that the participants might have and builds rapport between the team and the participants.
-  **Un-moderated usability studies:** In an un-moderated study there is no guide and the participant can use the product wherever and whenever the decide to use it and they record their interactions and share it with the team. This is better than a moderated study since it's a real-life demo and shows exactly how the end-user is going to use the product.

## Advantages and disadvantages of moderated studies
Following are the advantages and dis-advantages of moderated usability studies.

**Advantages:**
   
- Moderated usability studies help in building a solid rapport  between the moderating team and the participants.
-  Moderated studies allows the team to witness how the end-user interacts with their product after the initial demo firsthand.
- The moderators can give live guidance to the participants and telling them how they can use their product more efficiently.
- Moderated studies allows the team to test how can user divert from the recommended user journey path and would could be done to guide them to the right path. Sometimes the participants that divert from the recommended path can create a new path that could be easier.
- A moderator keeps the flow of the session from being interrupted and helps participants stay focused, which makes the study more productive overall.
- The moderator team can help explain the given prompts or re-phrase the textual information if a participant fails to understand and this helps to collect more information about the design and guiding text being used.
- Moderated studies allow the participants to explain their feedback in a more simpler and elaborate way which can lead to better insights about the current design of the product.

**Dis-advantages:**

- Moderated studies can influence bias since the moderator may influence the study even without them doing it purposely.
- If the moderator isn't friendly or has a hard time connecting with the participants then they might not tell them about their experience in more depth and just give enough answers to get the study over.
- Moderated studies happen during business hours since the moderator needs to be present at the study and this cuts of a lot of people that should be included in the study and makes the participant pool smaller.
- Similar to operating in business hours the participants that do come for study will need to adjust their schedules and calendars which may cut off even more people.
-  The moderation team also has to make sure that there are no technical issues during the study as this can make people wait and can even make the session end without any work being done.
- Moderated usability studies are also very high-budget, You need to rent a venue, seating arrangements, presentation arrangements, and other misc expenses can make it more costly.

## Advantages and dis-advantages of un-moderated studies
Following are the advantages and dis-advantages of un-moderated usability studies.

**Advantages:**

- In an un-moderated study the participant interacts with the product how the real end-user would, without any help from others. This makes the first impressions and understanding more accurate.
- An un-moderated study can be done by anyone and anywhere so they can have access to the full diverse participant pool that a moderated study doesn't.
- There are no time and place constraints on un-moderated studies since the participant can complete it whenever they want to.
- Un-moderated studies are also more cost-efficient since you just need to give access to your product to the participants.
- un-moderated studies are also more privacy respecting since the participant doesn't need to disclose any private information in public.

**Dis-advantages:**

- Un-moderated studies don't provide any real-time guidance to the participants and if they have any difficulty understanding or using the product then there would be no one to provide support.
- There are also no live follow ups for an un-moderated study and you cannot record the first time experience of the participant.
- Since the study is done whenever the participant want to do it there can be distractions that can make the participants attention to divert or leave the study mid-way.
-  In order for you to provide your product to the selected participants you will need some way of distributing it and this can cause privacy breaches and may not be accessible to the participants that have any kind disabilities or use assistive technologies.
- The amount of data collected will be huge as compared to an un-moderated study so its best suited to use un-moderated studies for simple user journeys and not include any complex tasks or user flow.

# Best practices for a usability study
The first thing you want to do is to make sure that the participants are comfortable throughout the whole study session as this creates a professional and friendly environment.

After welcoming the participants ask general questions about how they're doing or what their day has been like and thank them for investing their time into this study.

After welcoming the participants ask general questions about how they're doing or what their day has been like and thank them for investing their time into this study. After the study session has concluded include a parting gift that and remind them that their input is going to be helping all the people that will use the product.

## The required paperwork

If your study contains any un-released information about the product that you're testing and you don't want it to be public then you must first make sure that all the participants sign a non-disclosure agreement or NDA for short.

The NDA agreement should be signed after the welcoming and making sure that the participants are comfortable. If the participants want to sign the agreement move forward with them and if they don't kindly ask them to leave before starting.

Showing the road-map of your product to the interested participants is also a good idea.

## Be neutral and keep the user at the front

In moderated usability studies the moderating team has to make sure that they are neutral in all aspects since the way the act or talk to participants can force any kind of bias and that can impact the result of the study.

The participant is the most important thing of the usability study.
