# Plan a research study
In the context of user-experience, a research study is process that involves an step-by-step process to find out more about the problem that the user is currently facing so that the direct-feedback can be integrated in the designs.

## Research study process
To conduct a successful research study every UX researcher follows three or more steps according to their own preferences and requirements. The most simplest way to conduct a research is by planning for it, conducting it, and then analyzing the results.

The first step is all about the preparations that the UX researcher needs to do is to make sure that there isn't any problem during the study. Invite all of the participants few days earlier, make sure the testing environment is comfortable and list all of the necessary questions.

The second step is to conduct the study and collect data from the users. There are multiple ways to this and which ever method is required and is most suitable should be used. The third and final step is to organize all of the collected data and analyze it to gain important insights that will help you in your design process.

> There is way more things involved in a research study but these three steps are the gist of it.

# Planning the study
When starting to create a plan for the upcoming research study there are seven important things that you should keep in mind are the project background, the goals of the research, the research questions, the key-performance indicators, the methods, and most importantly the participants.

The first thing in the first phase, (Pun intended) is figuring out the project's background and find out the reason why we are conducting this research in the first place. 

The second thing is the goals that you intended to complete with this research, it can include things like why are customers only ordering between a specific time frame or finding out what new features your current and potential customers might want in your product. You also need to create simple and effective questions that can help you get the most insights out from each participant.

The next step is ton identify the  key-performance indicators that can be used to measure the success of the study. Things the total number of respondents that didn't leave a single question could be a KPI that you should keep in mind.

KPIs can be different and the methods that you use to conduct your surveys can also be different. You can either setup a public survey booth, ask people around in the streets and even send emails to your clients and your newsletter subscribers.

Collecting the data should be the next thing on the check list.  How will you gather the collected information from the survey? Spreadsheets and databases are useful if the data is only from a few respondents or a large number of respondents respectively.

The people participating in the survey are the most important. You have to make sure that they are comfortable when they are giving their answers and if you have the budget for it make sure that you give them an incentive for taking the survey.

> It is important to keep in mind that the participant pool for your survey should diverse so that there is no bias of any kind in the results.

## Creating a research plan
By creating a step-by-step research plan it will be easier for you to manage your work.  The first things to add in the research plan is the project background, goals, and questions because these are crucial to the study.

The background of the project helps to make sure everyone know why are we conducting this research and they have the required knowledge about the problem that we are facing currently. The research goals specify the reason for conducting the research and what are you trying to accomplish using this research. 

The question that you'll be asking the participants is the most important thing because it is very important to use language that is non-offensive and professional and the questions shouldn't be longer than a few sentences. Keep them short and simple so that they can be understood by everyone.

## Types of research
All of the research conducted during the start of the project is called foundational research and its purpose is to make sure that we have a problem or not or are we trying to solve some problem that doesn't exist in the first place.

The research that is done during the design phase is called design research (duh!) and it helps in building out the design to suit the users and the research done after the product has been launched is called post-launch research and it helps in finding out any problems in the finished product and the opinions of the user after using the product.

## Key performance indicators
Key performance indicators or KPIs for short are the fourth part of a successful project plan that help in measuring the effectiveness of the research that you conducted and if the research goals have been met or not.

You can have multiple and multi-type KPIs in your project that are used to measure different aspects of different things related to the ongoing research.

## Different methods of research
The fifth part of the research plan is the way you will conduct your research and collect the required information.  You can conduct online surveys, ask around people on the streets and whatever way that you find best.

Whatever method that you choose should have a solid reason for it since it will be easier to make the stakeholders easier to understand. 

> In order for your research to be reliable, you need to document it in a way thatÂ  another researcher could repeat it and find similar results.

The method of your research will also be influenced by the type of data that you're collecting. There are different types of data collection for quantitative data and different methods for qualitative data.

## Selecting participants for the study
A UX research study cannot be completed without asking the questions to the participants that have decided to come/participate in this study.

When selecting candidates for research studies make sure that you have a wide-variety of people answering your questions. Include people from different walks of life, different regions, different cultures, and don't forget to include people that have some kind of disabilities. 

It is very important that you add the opinions of people that are disabled or rely on assistive technologies for using your product so that you can get a look from a different perspective and make your product inclusive and accessible to everyone.

Creating a script that follows a pattern that the questions that you have selected could be asked in an top-down fashion is recommended so that you can ask each participant the same question and don't miss any questions with any participants.

# Respect the user's privacy
When conducting any kind of survey, privacy is one of the most crucial aspects that the researcher has to keep in mind. You should value the privacy of the participants and ask for their consent before starting the survey and tell them how their data is going to be used.

In the same way if you're conducting research about a product or feature that is unreleased and confidential you can make sure that the participant doesn't share the data with anyone outside by making them sign an non-disclosure agreement and if they don't sign it you can exclude them from the survey.

> Keeping the data safe and secure is also important.
